A(nother) first post to mark the beginning of my blog here on github pages.

I've been meaning to start for some time, but couldn't think of the right topics to begin with.

I also realised that there are some books in my collection that I really want to read from cover-to-cover, instead of cherry picking chapters, which I've been _very_ guilty of.

An aha moment was when I decided to read the damn things & post something about them, maybe a running commentary of my thoughts, maybe my mis-adventures with the example projects, or even _gasp_ a book review.

So, I begin, with the best of intentions _(as always)_.
