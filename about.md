I've been programming since I first laid eyes on my father's ZX Sinclair. I've started this blog as place to pen down my thoughts as I attempt to become a "good programmer with great habits". _My apologies to Kent Beck for "borrowing" his quote._

### More Information
I love listening to music, but can't sing or play an instrument to save my life. I'm marginally better at sports, except for cricket (this being an Indian, is a paradox of such massive proportions, that it threatens to collapse in on itself)
